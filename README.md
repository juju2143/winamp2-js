# Winamp2-js

A reimplementation of Winamp 2.9 in HTML5 and Javascript.

Works in modern versions of Firefox, Safari and Chrome. Untested in IE.

This fork contains a few dirty hacks that adds Shoutcast/Icecast streaming support and ponies and might have broken other stuff.

## Features

- Drag in local sound or skin files or load them via the "eject" button
- "Shade" mini-mode

## Tested in modern versions of

- Chrome (OS X, iOS, Ubuntu) - Perfect
- Firefox (OS X) - Perfect
- Safari (OS X, iOS) - Perfect

## Predecessors

- [Webamp2x](http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=91850) An
  impressive implementation from 2002(!). Doesn't seem to work/play in my
  modern browsers.

- [Winamp em HTML5 e Javascript](http://www.tidbits.com.br/winamp-em-html5-e-javascript)
  In 2010 a developer named Danilo posted one of his HTML5 experiments: "an
  audio player simulating good old Winamp". You will have to download the zip
  file.

- [JuicyDrop](http://cggaurav.github.io/juicydrop/) An HTML5 implementation with
  less empasis on being true to the skin, but fully featured visualizations.
  @cggaurav is keeping it alive on [GitHub](https://github.com/cggaurav/juicydrop)

- [Spotiamp](http://spotiamp.com/) The folks at Spotify reimplemented Winamp as
  a frontend for Spotify. Not in a browser, and only runs on Windows.
